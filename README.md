Copilot
Absolutely! Here's a full summary of your CustomGadgetApp project so you can easily continue in a new chat:

✅ Project: CustomGadgetApp
A customizable WPF desktop gadget built in Visual Studio Code, featuring:

🕒 Features Implemented
Live Clock (UK time, updates every second)
Weather Forecast using Open-Meteo (UKMO model)
Transparent, draggable WPF window
Settings panel to customize clock font size
GitHub integration: ghhenrisar/CustomGadgetApp

🔧 Code Improvements
Implemented INotifyPropertyChanged for live UI updates
Added SettingsWindow.xaml and Settings.Designer.cs
Fixed GitHub sync and build issues
Resolved Properties.Settings.Default errors
Cleaned up WeatherModel.cs with nullable reference type fixes

⚠️ Outstanding Tasks
✅ WeatherModel.cs fixed (nullable warnings resolved)
⏳ WeatherViewModel.cs still needs review and cleanup for nullable warnings
🧪 Font size customization works — needs testing for persistence
🧩 Optional next features:
🎨 Theme customization (colors, dark mode)
📅 Calendar/date display
💾 Save/load window position and size
📦 App packaging for distribution

🔜 Next Steps
When you're ready to continue, just say:

"Let's continue CustomGadgetApp — fix WeatherViewModel.cs warnings"
or
"Add theme customization to CustomGadgetApp"

I'll pick up right where we left off.

Looking forward to continuing with you!
